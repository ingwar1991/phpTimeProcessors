# timeProcessors
TimeProcessors is a PHP library that provides powerful tools for working with time frames and time zones in PHP. 
It simplifies the handling of time-related data, making it easier to perform operations and transformations involving dates, 
times, and time zones.

## Timeframe
The Timeframe class is designed to manage and process time periods or intervals. 
It allows you to define, manipulate, and perform operations on time frames with ease. 
Whether you're working with date ranges, durations, or specific intervals, Timeframe streamlines these tasks.

### Key Features:
* Create and manage time frames (e.g., 1 year, 3 month, 1 week, etc).
* Support for operations like calculating duration, overlaps, and gaps between time frames.
* Easy manipulation of time intervals (e.g., adding/subtracting days, months, etc.).

## Timezone
The Timezone class helps you handle time zone conversions and manipulations effortlessly. It allows you to work with different time zones, 
convert between them, and ensure your application operates correctly across various geographical locations.

### Key Features:
* Convert times between different time zones (e.g., from UTC to PST).
* Automatically handle daylight saving time (DST) changes and other time zone peculiarities.
* Support for working with date/time values in different time zones and formats.
